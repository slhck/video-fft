# video-fft

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/video-fft.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/video-fft)

Calculate the magnitude spectrum of a video sequence, via Fast Fourier Transform.

## What this does

The package calculates the magnitude spectrum of each frame's luminance data.

This allows, for example, identifying upscaled parts of a video, such as when someone upscaled HD content to UHD. By analyzing the spectrum, you can see that the actual high frequencies that would be expected for "real" UHD content are not present, or not as present as you'd normally see.

![](example.png)

The above example shows three sources (each source is one row), with the left image corresponding to the HD version of the source, upscaled to UHD, and the right image being the actual UHD source. The grey "boxes" in the left column tell you that the actual content is merely HD.

The package also outputs the azimuthally averaged 1D power spectrum, from which the high frequencies are extracted and summed up to give one "score" per frame.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- FFmpeg libraries (to run `pyav`)

Under Ubuntu, to get ffmpeg libraries:

    sudo apt install libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libavfilter-dev libswscale-dev libavresample-dev

Under macOS, it is recommended to install ffmpeg via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

    brew install ffmpeg

## Installation

```
pip3 install video-fft
```

## Usage

To run it, simply call `video-fft` with the path to your video file:

```bash
video-fft /path/to/video.mp4
```

This will output a progress bar for each frame, and finally output the statistics as JSON.

You can enable output of magnitude spectrum images via three options:

- `-r`/`--first-frame`: Only output the first frame of the video
- `-a`/`--all-frames`: Output all frames
- `-m`/`--mean`: Output an averaged magnitude spectrum for all frames

The images will be saved next to the input file, unless you choose a different output path (via `-o`/`--output`).

For more info, see `video-fft -h`:

```
usage: video-fft [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-n NUM_FRAMES] [-of {json,csv}] [-r] [-a] [-m] [-s SCALE] [-q] input

positional arguments:
  input                 Input video file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output path for the images, default: same as input video file (default: None)
  -n NUM_FRAMES, --num-frames NUM_FRAMES
                        Number of frames to calculate (default: None)
  -of {json,csv}, --output-format {json,csv}
                        Select output format (default: json)
  -r, --first-frame     Render image for radial profile of the first frame (default: False)
  -a, --all-frames      Render image for radial profile of all frames (default: False)
  -m, --mean            Render image for mean/average radial profile of the entire sequence (default: False)
  -s SCALE, --scale SCALE
                        Image scaling, adjust to increase/decrease rendered image size (default: 1)
  -q, --quiet           Do not show progress bar (default: False)
```
